Version 3.0.4 (14 Jan 2015)
===========================

2015-01-12: olly
	    [PHP] Fix segfault in director upcall check when using PHP built with
	    ZTS enabled.  Fixes #155, reported by Pierre Labastie.

2015-01-12: vadz
            [Python] Fix #294 #296 - Regression introduced in SWIG-3.0.3 when
            wrapping functions with default arguments. Invalid or missing default
            arguments were sometimes being generated into the python layer.

2015-01-08: olly
	    Allow C++11 "explicit constexpr".  Fixes github issue #284 reported
	    by Pawe≈Ç Tomulik.  Also handle "constexpr explicit" and "constexpr
	    static".

2015-01-08: olly
	    When reporting an error for a construct which hasn't been
	    terminated when the end of the file is reached, report it at the
	    start line rather than "EOF" as then tools like editors and IDEs
	    will take you to a generally more useful place for fixing the
	    problem.

2015-01-08: olly
	    Improve error messages for a few cases which previously gave the
	    one of the cryptic catch-all errors "Syntax error in input".

2015-01-08: olly
	    Provide -cppext as a general command line option for setting the
	    extension used for generated C++ files (previously it was specific
	    to the PHP backend).  Deprecate the equivalent -suffix option
	    provided by the Ocaml backend, but continue to support that for
	    now.
